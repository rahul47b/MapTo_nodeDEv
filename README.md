Node.js is an open-source framework for building fast, scalable network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Node.js is a free and open-source server environment that can run on a wide range of platforms. Node.js also gives you access to a large library of JavaScript modules, which substantially simplifies the development of Node.js web applications. It enables developers to utilize JavaScript to construct command-line tools and server-side scripting, which is the process of running scripts on the server to generate dynamic web page content before transmitting the page to the userâ€™s browser. Ryan Dahl invented the Node.js framework in 2009.
